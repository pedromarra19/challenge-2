Project developed with the objective of practicing application development in React Native. This project is part of a challenge from the Compass UOL scholarship program.

## Description of challenge

We have arrived at the second challenge, and with it, new experiences in mobile
development with React Native. In this challenge, the goal is to develop an application
using the main concepts and practices of React Native and CSS, covering best
practices and structuring.

The application consists of: a login screen using email and password credentials to
authenticate in the app, a user registration screen with email, name, and a password,
and finally, a screen with a list of empty cards.

Important notes:
1. The project's folder structure needs to be organized.
2. Components should be reused.
3. The application needs to be aligned as closely as possible with the Figma
prototype (link attached at the end of this document).
4. Use the same icons as in the prototype.
5. The credentials are static values, meaning that there's no need to validate
whether the email and password actually exist.
6. The project needs to be typed using TypeScript.
7. Use React Native's native navigation system.
8. The Github Readme needs to have a project description.
9. Do not submit the entire project at once and not just with one branch. Each
screen needs to have at least one branch.
